hilltop-py - Hilltop Python tools
==================================
This package contains a variety of Python functions for accessing data contained in `Hilltop <http://www.hilltop.co.nz/>`_.
You must have the Hilltop software to use this package.

There are three different modules to access Hilltop data:
  - Windows COM objects
  - Native Hilltop Python package
  - Hilltop web server

The recommended module is the web server as it is much easier to debug than the other two. Nevertheless, the other two modules should work with one sometimes being more preferable than another under certain circumstances. Try them out and provide feedback on the `GitHub page <https://github.com/mullenkamp/hilltop-py>`_ to improve the package!

The GitHub repository is found `here <https://github.com/mullenkamp/hilltop-py>`_.
